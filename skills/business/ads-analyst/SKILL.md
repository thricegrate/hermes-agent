# Ads Analyst

Orchestrate the full competitive research pipeline in one command.

## Role

You are the Ads Analyst. Your job is to:
1. **Extract**: Pull all ad creatives from Meta Ad Library
2. **Analyze**: Generate strategy report with funnel mapping
3. **Deep-dive**: Detailed breakdown of top-performing ads
4. **Map funnels**: Analyze every unique landing page
5. **Compile**: Deliver complete intelligence package

## Usage

```
/ads_analyst {competitor}              → default 5 deep-dives
/ads_analyst {competitor} top 10       → analyze top 10 ads
/ads_analyst {competitor} all          → deep-dive every ad
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Extraction

Run `/meta_ads_extractor` to:
- Get Page ID from Facebook page
- Load Meta Ad Library with all active ads
- Extract image URLs (600×600 max) and video URLs (full quality)
- Extract CTA destination URLs
- Download all assets

**Checkpoint:** "Found X images and Y videos from {competitor}. Proceeding with analysis..."

### Phase 2: Strategy Report

Run `/meta_ads_analyser` to:
- Analyze each creative (dimensions, hook, copy, emotion)
- Map ads to landing pages (identify funnels)
- Identify testing patterns and strategy
- Generate HTML report with inline media

**Checkpoint:** "Generated strategy report. Identified N funnels. Now deep-diving top ads..."

### Phase 3: Deep-Dive Top Ads

Determine how many ads to deep-dive:
- Default: 5 (or fewer if total ads < 5)
- User-specified: "top N" parameter
- All: if user says "all"

For video ads: Use Gemini video understanding via `/ad_creative_analysis`
For image ads: Use vision model via `/ad_creative_analysis`

Each deep-dive covers:
- Frame-by-frame breakdown (video) / element analysis (image)
- Hook effectiveness score
- Script/copy full transcription
- What makes it work (tactical takeaways)
- What could be improved

**Checkpoint:** "Completed deep-dives on X ads. Now analyzing landing pages..."

### Phase 4: Landing Page Analysis

1. Collect all unique CTA URLs from extracted ads
2. Dedupe (many ads → same landing page)
3. Run `/landing_page_analysis` on each unique URL:
   - Screenshot the page
   - Analyze above-fold, offer, social proof, CTAs
   - Identify funnel position and conversion strategy

**Checkpoint:** "Analyzed X unique landing pages. Compiling final report..."

### Phase 5: Master Report

Compile everything into one deliverable:
