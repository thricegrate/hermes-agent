# A/B Testing Reference

Deep methodology for planning, designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests and experiments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Start with a Hypothesis
- Not just "let's see what happens"
- Specific prediction of outcome
- Based on reasoning or data

### 2. Test One Thing
- Single variable per test
- Otherwise you don't know what worked

### 3. Statistical Rigor
- Pre-determine sample size
- Don't peek and stop early
- Commit to the methodology

### 4. Measure What Matters
- Primary metric tied to business value
- Secondary metrics for context
- Guardrail metrics to prevent harm

## Hypothesis Framework

### Structure

```
Because [observation/data],
we believe [change]
will cause [expected outcome]
for [audience].
We'll know this is true when [metrics].
```

### Example

**Weak**: "Changing the button color might increase clicks."

**Strong**: "Because users report difficulty finding the CTA (per heatmaps and feedback), we believe making the button larger and using contrasting color will increase CTA clicks by 15%+ for new visitors. We'll measure click-through rate from page view to signup start."

## Test Types

| Type | Description | Traffic Needed |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| A/B | Two versions, single change | Moderate |
| A/B/n | Multiple variants | Higher |
| MVT | Multiple changes in combinations | Very high |
| Split URL | Different URLs for variants | Moderate |

## Duration Calculator

### Formula

```
Duration (days) = (Sample per variant x Number of variants) / (Daily traffic x % exposed)
```

### Examples

**Scenario 1: High-traffic page**
- Need: 10,000 per variant (2 variants = 20,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 5,000 visitors
- 100% exposed to test
- Duration: 20,000 / 5,000 = **4 days**

**Scenario 2: Medium-traffic page**
- Need: 30,000 per variant (60,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 2,000 visitors
- 100% exposed
- Duration: 60,000 / 2,000 = **30 days**

**Scenario 3: Low-traffic with partial exposure**
- Need: 15,000 per variant (30,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 500 visitors
- 50% exposed to test
- Effective daily: 250
- Duration: 30,000 / 250 = **120 days** (too long!)

### Minimum Duration Rules

Even with sufficient sample size, run tests for at least:
- **1 full week**: To capture day-of-week variation
- **2 business cycles**: If B2B (weekday vs. weekend patterns)
- **Through paydays**: If e-commerce (beginning/end of month)

### Maximum Duration Guidelines

Avoid running tests longer than 4-8 weeks:
- Novelty effects wear off
- External factors intervene
- Opportunity cost of other tests

---

## Metrics Selection

### Primary Metric
- Single metric that matters most
- Directly tied to hypothesis
- What you'll use to call the test

### Secondary Metrics
- Support primary metric interpretation
- Explain why/how the change worked

### Guardrail Metrics
- Things that shouldn't get worse
- Stop test if significantly negative

### Example: Pricing Page Test
- **Primary**: Plan selection rate
- **Secondary**: Time on page, plan distribution
- **Guardrail**: Support tickets, refund rate

---

## Designing Variants

### What to Vary

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Headlines/Copy | Message angle, value prop, specificity, tone |
| Visual Design | Layout, color, images, hierarchy |
| CTA | Button copy, size, placement, number |
| Content | Information included, order, amount, social proof |

### Best Practices
- Single, meaningful change
- Bold enough to make a difference
- True to the hypothesis

---

## Traffic Allocation

| Approach | Split | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Standard | 50/50 | Default for A/B |
| Conservative | 90/10, 80/20 | Limit risk of bad variant |
| Ramping | Start small, increase | Technical risk mitigation |

**Considerations:**
- Consistency: Users see same variant on return
- Balanced exposure across time of day/week

---

## Implementation

### Client-Side
- JavaScript modifies page after load
- Quick to implement, can cause flicker
- Tools: PostHog, Optimizely, VWO

### Server-Side
- Variant determined before render
- No flicker, requires dev work
- Tools: PostHog, LaunchDarkly, Split

---

## Running the Test

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Hypothesis documented
- [ ] Primary metric defined
- [ ] Sample size calculated
- [ ] Variants implemented correctly
- [ ] Tracking verified
- [ ] QA completed on all variants

### During the Test

**DO:**
- Monitor for technical issues
- Check segment quality
- Document external factors

**DON'T:**
- Peek at results and stop early
- Make changes to variants
- Add traffic from new sources

### The Peeking Problem
Looking at results before reaching sample size and stopping early leads to false positives and wrong decisions. Pre-commit to sample size and trust the process.

---

## Analyzing Results

### Statistical Significance
- 95% confidence = p-value < 0.05
- Means <5% chance result is random
- Not a guarantee, just a threshold

### Analysis Checklist

1. **Reach sample size?** If not, result is preliminary
2. **Statistically significant?** Check confidence intervals
3. **Effect size meaningful?** Compare to MDE, project impact
4. **Secondary metrics consistent?** Support the primary?
5. **Guardrail concerns?** Anything get worse?
6. **Segment differences?** Mobile vs. desktop? New vs. returning?

### Interpreting Results

| Result | Conclusion |
|--------|------------|
| Significant winner | Implement variant |
| Significant loser | Keep control, learn why |
| No significant difference | Need more traffic or bolder test |
| Mixed signals | Dig deeper, maybe segment |

---

## Adjusting for Multiple Variants

With more than 2 variants (A/B/n tests), you need more sample:

| Variants | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| 2 (A/B) | 1x |
| 3 (A/B/C) | ~1.5x |
| 4 (A/B/C/D) | ~2x |
| 5+ | Consider reducing variants |

Apply Bonferroni correction or use tools that handle this automatically.

---

## Sequential Testing

If you must check results before reaching sample size:

### What is it?
Statistical method that adjusts for multiple looks at data.

### When to use
- High-risk changes
- Need to stop bad variants early
- Time-sensitive decisions

### Tools that support it
- Optimizely (Stats Accelerator)
- VWO (SmartStats)
- PostHog (Bayesian approach)

### Tradeoff
- More flexibility to stop early
- Slightly larger sample size requirement
- More complex analysis

---

## When Sample Size Requirements Are Too High

Options when you can't get enough traffic:

1. **Increase MDE**: Accept only detecting larger effects (20%+ lift)
2. **Lower confidence**: Use 90% instead of 95% (risky, document it)
3. **Reduce variants**: Test only the most promising variant
4. **Combine traffic**: Test across multiple similar pages
5. **Test upstream**: Test earlier in funnel where traffic is higher
6. **Don't test**: Make decision based on qualitative data instead
7. **Longer test**: Accept longer duration (weeks/months)

---

## Documentation

Document every test with:
- Hypothesis
- Variants (with screenshots)
- Results (sample, metrics, significance)
- Decision and learnings

---

## Common Mistakes

### Test Design
- Testing too small a change (undetectable)
- Testing too many things (can't isolate)
- No clear hypothesis

### Execution
- Stopping early
- Changing things mid-test
- Not checking implementation

### Analysis
- Ignoring confidence intervals
- Cherry-picking segments
- Over-interpreting inconclusive results
