# Paywall & Upgrade Screen CRO Reference

Deep methodology for optimizing in-app paywalls, upgrade screens, upsell modals, feature gates, and trial expiration flows.

Distinct from public pricing pages (see page.md): this focuses on in-product upgrade moments where the user has already experienced value.

## Core Principles

### 1. Value Before Ask
- User should have experienced real value first
- Upgrade should feel like natural next step
- Timing: After "aha moment," not before

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell
- Demonstrate the value of paid features
- Preview what they're missing
- Make the upgrade feel tangible

### 3. Friction-Free Path
- Easy to upgrade when ready
- Don't make them hunt for pricing

### 4. Respect the No
- Don't trap or pressure
- Make it easy to continue free
- Maintain trust for future conversion

## Paywall Trigger Points

### Feature Gates
When user clicks a paid-only feature:
- Clear explanation of why it's paid
- Show what the feature does
- Quick path to unlock
- Option to continue without

### Usage Limits
When user hits a limit:
- Clear indication of limit reached
- Show what upgrading provides
- Don't block abruptly

### Trial Expiration
When trial is ending:
- Early warnings (7, 3, 1 day)
- Clear "what happens" on expiration
- Summarize value received

### Time-Based Prompts
After X days of free use:
- Gentle upgrade reminder
- Highlight unused paid features
- Easy to dismiss

## Paywall Screen Components

1. **Headline** - Focus on what they get: "Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]"
2. **Value Demonstration** - Preview, before/after, "With Pro you could..."
3. **Feature Comparison** - Highlight key differences, current plan marked
4. **Pricing** - Clear, simple, annual vs. monthly options
5. **Social Proof** - Customer quotes, "X teams use this"
6. **CTA** - Specific and value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"
7. **Escape Hatch** - Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"
